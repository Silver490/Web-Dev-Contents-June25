1. How to start an express server
    a. npm init -y
    b. npm install express
    c. create index.js file
    d. write code to start server
    --------------index.js----------------
    const express = require('express');
    const app = express();
    app.listen(4444, () => {
    console.log("Server is running on http://localhost:4444");});

    e. node index.js to start server
    f. use nodemon to auto restart server on code change
    g. npm install -g nodemon
    h. nodemon index.js to start server with auto restart




what is static file?
it is a file which does not change for every user
eg: html,css,js,image files

what is dynamic file?
it is a file which changes for every user
eg: json file
eg: user profile page, user dashboard



3.  3 ways to serve static files in express JS
    a. Using express.static() middleware
    b. Using res.sendFile() method
    c. Using res.download() method

sendFile sends the file to the frontend to view
eg: res.sendFile(__dirname+"/index.html") 
or res.sendFile(path.join(__dirname,"/index.html"))

- every time we use script or style in html file it makes a request to server to get that file
- so we need to make those files static so that server can serve them
- we can use express.static() middleware to make a folder static
- we must include html file in static folder

jo bhi file is needed inside html file usko staic folder me rakhna hai
it will check inside static folder for those files
if it is not found it will give 404 error


header error
issue occurs when we try to send multiple responses for a single request
eg:
app.get("/",(req,res)=>{
    res.send("Hello World");
    res.send("Hello World2"); // this will give header error
});

Important points while Making Todo:
- send all staic files inside static folder
- crud opertaions
- get request to show tasks


ways to send request
    postman
    browser
    AJAX - axios , fetch
    Templating Engins

static folder broweser pe gaya ab index.html pe jo code hai wo server pe bhej dega
eg. script, style adding

ways to send get and post by a browser
    1.form tag (can also send get)
    2. browser request bhejega toh broweser pe response jaayega
    3. every time we refresh it sends new request to that path that's why we redirect it to a get request
    4. page refresh when request is send through form
    5. when post request is sent by form, the url of browser will change, it may look like get request
       but it is send by form with post method
    6. AJAX request is XHR- it does'nt refresh browsers
